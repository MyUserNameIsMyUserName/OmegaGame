# OmegaGame Alt Version Test 000
> A quickstart template for a markdown-based docs site



## Features

- ðŸ“— Make a modern docs site â€“ using your awesome project's _existing_ markdown files
- ðŸ¤© Low code needed â€“ needs just a single HTML file, which has a JS section you can configure for your own project
- ðŸš€ Easily hosted on GH Pages â€“ a free static site with no build step needed


## Purpose
> How to use this project

- Create a **new repo** from the template and host it on GitHub Pages immediately. This is good for trying out Docsify or building a site project from scratch.
- Use this project as a **base** - follow instructions to download just the necessary files to your _existing_ repo's `docs` directory
- View the **live** demo site to see what you'll get.



## How to use Docsify in your projects

### Copy files

Use one of the approaches below to setup Docsify in your own project.

#### A. Use this template


### Customize

Yo

Now complete any remaining TODO items in the files.

### Use template readme

If you clicked _Use this template_, followed the customize steps above, then the last thing to do is replace the project's README.md file with the template one.

```sh
mv README.template.md README.md
```

Then customize README.md as your own project.


## Setup and run

### Remote use

Whatever approach you use to setup a _docs_ directory, you can use your own project or a forked template a site on Github Pages or Netlify.

There won't be any code to the site other than _docs_ site, but this is still fine as a standalone online demo of _Docsify_ that you can tweak.
